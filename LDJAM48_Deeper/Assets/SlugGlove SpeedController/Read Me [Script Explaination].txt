Player Movement Script

 MaxSpeed = how fast we run forward
SpeedClamp = how fast we can possibly be
InAirControl = how much control you have over your movement direction when in air

 Acceleration = how fast we build speed
 Decceleration = how fast we slow down
DirectionControl = how much control we have over changing direction
Stickyness = how much we stick to the ground (for use on slopes


MaxSlopeAmt = the max  slope that will influence our player
 MinSlopeAmt = the smallest slope that will influence our player
SlopeSpeedGain = the max speed we can add to our controllerSlopeSpeedLoss = the min speed we can add to our controller

SpeedNeededToCheck = how fast we must be going to check distance
     TimeBtwSpeedChecks = how frequently we check for distance between positions
    private float SpeedCheckTime = actual timer
     DistanceNeeded = the distance needed for are player to move

     TurnSpeed = how fast we turn when on the ground
     TurnSpeedInAir = how fast we turn when in air
     TurnSpeedSliding = how fast we are when sliding
     TurnSpeedOnWalls = how fast we are when running on a wall



     MaxSpeedBoostOnJump
     JumpHeight = how high we jump

     BackFlipHeight = how high a backflip is
     BackFlipBackwards = how far backwards we go on backflip

     LeapHeight = how high up our leap is
     LeapForwards = for far forwards our leep is

     JumpHoldAmt = how much holding jump adds to a jump 
     JumpHoldTime = how long we can hold jump for
     fallMultiplier = 2.5f = multiplier to falling 
     lowJumpMultiplier = 2f = multiplier to begining of jump

     SpeedBeforeWallRun = how fast we must be before wall running
     WallRunTime = how long we can run on walls
     TimeBeforeWallRun = how long we have to be in the air before we can wallrun
     WallRunUpwardsMovement = how much we move up a wall when running on it (make this 0 to just slightly move down a wall we run on
     WallRunSpeedAcceleration = how quickly we build speed to run up walls

     CrouchSpeed = how fast we move when crouching

     SlideAmt = how far we slide when pressing crouch
     SlideSpeedLimit = how fast we have to be traveling before a crouch will stop
     SpeedBeforeSlide = how fast we are going before we can slide
     SlideTime = how long we can slide for

     PullUpTime = the time it takes to pull onto a ledge

     TimeBtwRespawn
    private float RespawnTimer

Player Collision Script
The red line in the inspector displays the distace from the ground, to check the angle of the floor
The red sphere will display the check for ground below our player
the green line will display the check for walls we can run on
the blue line displays the position and distance we check for a ledge to grab on to

   FloorSize= how large the floor check is
     FloorDis= how large the detection for the floors is
     bottomOffset= offset from player centre
     WallCheckDistance= how large the detection for the walls is
     UpOffset= offset from the players centre 

     LedgeGrabForwardPos= the position in front of the player where we check for ledges
     LedgeGrabUpwardsPos= the position in above of the player where we check for ledges
     LedgeGrabDistance= the distance the ledge can be from our raycast before we grab it (this is projects from the top of the wall grab position, downwards

    public LayerMask FloorLayers= what layers we can stand on
    public LayerMask WallLayers  = what layers we can wall run on
    public LayerMask LedgeGrabLayers= what layers we will grab onto


camera control
FollowSpd = how fast we follow the player
 MouseSpeed = how sensetive our mouse movements are
    ControllerSpeed = how sensetive our controller movements are

    LookLeftRightSpeed = how fast we look left and right
    LookUpSpeed = how fast we look up and down

    NormalPos = the normal position and angle the players camera will be at
    HighPos = the highest position our camera will move to when looking down
    LowPos = the lowest postion our camera will move to when looking up

    Smoothing = smoothing to apply to our cameras movements

    MaxFov = when moving at a high speed our cameras FOV will increase, this is the highest amount it will reach
    FOVSpeed = how fast we must go before we reach max fov
    FovMinSpeed = how slow we will be before the fov will change (at 10 the player must reach a speed of 10 to change the fov
